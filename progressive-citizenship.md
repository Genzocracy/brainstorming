# Progressive Citizenship
The concept of citizenship is not one that is considered 0% or 100% but to be provided as something earned over time. Citizenship status is not to exceed 100% for any
entity.

# Immediate Citizenship Earnings
There are 2 basic systems given to an entity at birth, based either on their location of birth, or their parents. In order to slow-but-not-prevent 


## Birthright (Jus Solis)
Being born on the soil of the nation provides an additional 20% increase in citizenship status to any other factor. In order to slow the abuse of birthright citizenship,
it is considered, but doesn't confer 100% status. 

## Law of Blood (Jus Sanguinis)
Any human entity capable of self-sustainment outside a biological womb can be granted the citizenship status that is a maximum of the citizenship status of any known
biological parent.

### Example 1 - Two parents (simple case)
A child is coming to the hospital with a mother who is accompanied with the biological father. The mother has a current citizenship status of 80% and the father has a
current citizenship status of 20%. The child is immediately given an 80% status.

### Example 2 - Single mother
The additional genetic source of the child is either not known, has denounced parenthood, or is a non-involved donor (permission is all that is deemed necessary to be an 
"involved" donor). The mother has a 50% citizenship status, and that 50% status is also immediately given to the child.

It should be stated that a sperm donor cannot give universal parental permission, and must be contacted to receive permission for each case, after conception.

### Example 3 - Three parents with permission
In the event that mitochondrial replacement in IVF has been made, then the child will receive the maximum of the 3 parents if all 3 parents have given parenthood consent.

## Law of the Orphan
Any child fostered, or given to guardianship by anyone with at least a 50% citizenship status, receives 100% status immediately, merely by being registered in the system.

# Attainment
The following factors adds points to citizenship status:
* Each semester-hour of accredited education passed confers an additional 0.2% to citizenship status (12 such hours per year give an 2.4% increase)
  * This is for any national accredited education, University or certification program, College and Kindergarten
  * There is a requirement that the education occur in the nation, a territory, a base, or a 
  * Since Kindergarten and primary schools do not necessarily start with separated programs, each semester is considered as a 12 hour program
  * Any system that uses less than a semester-hour system can prorate, such as a 0.1% increase for systems that work in quarters with the same hours
  * This would mean that certification programs, which may be a single 45 hour week, can confer 0.6% to citizenship
* Each active semester-hour serving as a teacher confers an additional 0.2% citizenship status
* Each hour of active service in the armed forces confers an additional 0.03% to citizenship status (more than 50% per full year)
* Each hour in reserve service, or in the National Guard, confers an additional 0.015% to citizenship status (more than 25% per full year)
* Each active hour serving in the Peace Corps confers and additional 0.015%
* Each active hour that is paid, serving in the medical field (doctor, surgeon, nurse, medical coder, etc.), confers an additional 0.005%
* Each active hour that is voluntary, serving in the medical field, confers an additional 0.01%
* Each active hour that is paid, serving in emergency services (fire, police, EMT, etc.), confers an additional 0.005%
* Each active hour that is voluntary, serving in the emergency services (volunteer fire, etc.) confers an additional 0.01%
* Others: rebuilding houses (not tourism system), 
* Any essential worker during a crisis
  * Any worker listed above is also an essential worker (such as care and emergency)
  * This then includes (needs a definition for infrastructure)
    * energy, water, wastewater, communications, IT
    * agriculture and food production
    * critical retail (grocery, hardware, mechanics)
    * critical trade, such as repair (electrician, construction, plumber, etc.)
    * transportation
    * logistics
    * government operations
* Any active paid hour of work for any company, where taxes are levied, within the nation confers a 0.001% increase


## Serious Question in Regards to Education
Does the advent of extremely smart AI change the paradigm around education?

# Citizenship Renunciation
These are the classificiations for each entity, in regards to citizenship status:
* Entities who are registered, and hold a non-zero citizenship status
* Entities who are registered nationally, but continue to hold 0% citizenship status (i.e. newcomers)
* Entities who remain unregistered and are assumed registered with another country (i.e. the current definition of "illegal")
* Entities who have either partially or entirely renounced their entire citizenship
  * This may include consented renunciation or renunciation based on criminality
  * This may include those that have reregistered with another nation
* 

Removal:
* Each year month oversees, outside of national service or political service, drops citizenship status by 1%, and is considered a partial renunciation, with penalty
* Declaring dual-citizenship will cap maximum citizenship status in the nation to 50%, and is considered a partial renunciation, with penalty
* Any individual may fully renounce their citizenship, capping their maximum status to 0%, with penalties for renunciation
* Criminal convictions (not arrests) can partially renounce citizenship status, such that
  * The only two crimes, which when convicted, can lead to expulsion from the nation are multiple murders and/or terroristic acts
  * The following convictions of crimes can penalize citizenship status (in addition to imprisonment) by no more than a maximum:
    * participating in an insurrection removes all of your citizenship status
    * [psychopathic murder] participating in a deliberate and premeditated killing with no intention of physical defense of self-or-others can remove up to 80% per victim
    * [emotional and/or impulsive murder] participating in a deliberate killing with no intention of physical defense of self-or-others can remove up to 50% per victim
    * [neglegent murder] participating in killing by disregard to your activities which are known to unreasonably risk human life can remvoe up to 20% per victim
    * Violence 
    * Theft (greater than 20% of the victim's earnings for 40-hour week worked) [can we calculate this back out instead of using hard-limits?] 5%
    * 


# Benefits and Scope of Citizenship
* Any entity who has registered is entitled a public defender (including for asylum seekers), or if another country permits, can request a public defender from any other country (paid for by that country)
* Any entity who has denounced their citizenship status, must hire a defender themselves, be allowed a defender from their current country, or represent themselves if they are sovereign
* Running for office:
  * Any entity with at least 50% citizenship status may run for and serve on local legislative offices
  * Any entity with at least 80% citizenship status may run for and serve on legislative offices
  * Any entity with at least 100% citizenship status may run for and serve as an executive, either in local offices or national offices
