# Progressive Citizenship
The concept of citizenship is not one that is considered 0% or 100% but to be provided as something earned over time. Citizenship status is not to exceed 100% for any
entity.

# Immediate Citizenship Earnings
There are 2 basic systems given to an entity at birth, based either on their location of birth, or their parents. In order to slow-but-not-prevent 


## Birthright (Jus Solis)
Being born on the soil of the nation provides an additional 20% increase in citizenship status to any other factor. In order to slow the abuse of birthright citizenship,
it is considered, but doesn't confer 100% status. 

## Law of Blood (Jus Sanguinis)
Any human entity capable of self-sustainment outside a biological womb can be granted the citizenship status that is a maximum of the citizenship status of any known
biological parent.

### Example 1 - Two parents (simple case)
A child is coming to the hospital with a mother who is accompanied with the biological father. The mother has a current citizenship status of 80% and the father has a
current citizenship status of 20%. The child is immediately given an 80% status.

### Example 2 - Single mother
The additional genetic source of the child is either not known, has denounced parenthood, or is a non-involved donor (permission is all that is deemed necessary to be an 
"involved" donor). The mother has a 50% citizenship status, and that 50% status is also immediately given to the child.

It should be stated that a sperm donor cannot give universal parental permission, and must be contacted to receive permission for each case, after conception.

### Example 3 - Three parents with permission
In the event that mitochondrial replacement in IVF has been made, then the child will receive the maximum of the 3 parents if all 3 parents have given parenthood consent.

## Law of the Orphan
Any child fostered, or given to guardianship by anyone with at least a 50% citizenship status, receives 100% status immediately, merely by being registered in the system.

# Attainment
The following factors adds points to citizenship status:
* Each year of education passed confers an additional 5% citizenship status
* Each year of service in the armed forces confers an additional 20% citizenship status
