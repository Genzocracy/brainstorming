# Types of Entities
A principal identifier is assigned to every registered entity. The principal identifier is only used to handle continuity, and is never to leave the offline database compound. Information going into the database and information leaving the database is done manually, and as needed. One or more proxy identifiers can be created for each entity, in order to handle situations such as witness protection, where a brand new identity must be made for the entity.

## Living Entities
Understanding that continuity of the physical self is a hard problem in philosophy, every attempt must be made to permit someone to identify themselves as the same living being that they were and the same being in the future. It may be necessary to modify the definition of a "continued entity" in the future into something taking topology into consideration.

There is a governmental preference to governing humans with hands-off the governing of other living entities, but recognizing the following:
* Humans do not exist in a vacuum, and other living beings are sharing our space
* Some of those living entities may contribute to society, and hence have varying levels of "political personhood" as the word is used to indicate the membership,  contribution, and effects associated with a society, either large or small
* It is recognized that "political personhood" is therefore something of variation and not an all-or-nothing category
* A non-person living entity would be more independant of all that we consider a society
* A non-person living entity which can be invested in to have an increased 2-way connection to our society is seen as a potential political person
* A living entity known to have potential for political personhood garner more weight in debates of political personhood than those where the potential is unknown, and those have more weight in political debates than those known to have no potential for political personhood
* Political personhood includes both rights and responsibilities

Without a significant rationale for accepting otherwise, an average human living entity taking part in the political process should always have a higher status of personhood than any non-living or organizational entity. However, this status of personhood, as is given by the responsibilities, is subject to the requirements of the general good, including the general caretaking of and investing in other entities.

## Non-Living Entities
In order to best approach the tragedy of the commons, some non-living entities will be recognized as legal entities. Depending on the bidirectional contributions to society, a non-living entity, such as a lake, may even have a reduced political personhood status, having certain rights tuned to the entity.

## Organizational Entities
Organizational units are given a separate status of entity from the entities that comprise the organization. 

### Family
The smallest unit of organization is a family, defined as an legal registered entity that shares resources for the purposes of investing in the caretaking of both potential political persons who are unable to care for themselves and/or entities that are unable to care for themselves for reasons such as disability, etc. The family organization is not limited to immediate caretaking, but also to caretaking that may arise, such as that of the medical or economic needs of a partner. There is no definition for what comprises a family organization, allowed to be a married couple with kids or a multigenerational family. The government does not take part in the personal and/or religious obligations related to a marriage.

Any member of a family can remove themselves from the entity by notification. If other requirements are necessary, such as imposing a order of restrainment, they can also be given.

A family can be dissolved by the government without their consent due to overwhelming evidence of abuse, neglect, or exploitation of a member or members of the entity. Dissolution would put any living entities, incapable of full self-determination, into tracked temporary systems, headed up by social volunteers. Reformation of the family in whole or in parts would be possible in a judicial setting. Due to the nature of family-separation, the highest priority of judicial review would be the handling of these cases.

An individual can declare (and change at a later time) a percentage of their income to family. The family would designate joint rights to decisions around financial spending. Anyone designated could legally make decisions about the joint income and could help make health decisions.

Regarding taxation, an individual is taxed at a percentage of income they retain, and a family is taxed at the same percentage of income jointly combined. It is economically treated the same as an individual. 

As an example:
* Individual A earns $1,000 for the month and contributes 20% to the family pot
* Individual B earns $100,000 for the month and contributes 30% to the family pot
* Individual C is a 5 year old child, earns no income, and contributes none

At tax time, if taxes are 20% of income:
* Individual A gives $200 to the family entity, pays ($1000 - $200) × 20% = $160 in taxes and then receives a fixed UBI payment
* Individual B gives $30,000 to the family entity, pays ($100,000 - $30,00) × 20% = $14,000 in taxes, and then receives a fixed UBI payment
* Individual C earns a UBI in their trust, which is unavailable to either individual A nor B
* The family entity earned an income of $30,200, which pays $6,040 in taxes, but receives no UBI

Without the family entity:
* Individual A would pay 20% on $1,000 for $200, and then receive the UBI
* Individual B would pay 20% on $100,000 for $20,000, and then receive the UBI
* Individual C would pay 20% on $0, and receive the UBI in their trust
* There is no family to pay out
* The total taxes would be $20,200, which is the same as the total they would have paid if they were not a family unit

With this in mind, the economic benefit to defining a family entity is one of shared and delegated powers for economic and health decisions only.

### Non-Profit
Non-profits are not subject to taxation, are not allowed to accept payment for services, but are allowed to accept donations, and government funds that operate similar to a UBI as a fixed income, based on a legal derivation of effort per service performed along with the number of times the service is performed (i.e. a legal derivation for "effort" is evaluated for the organization's stipend).

#### Media and Educational Non-Profit
A media non-profit is separated from other non-profits. It is difficult to define the service that a media and educational non-profit derives from. A higher stipend is provided to the organization for journalists that do foreign travel to either current or imminent war zones or to overseas disaster areas. Next smaller is the stipend provided to the organization for journalists that travel to domestic zones of disaster or current/imminent war. Next smaller is the stipend provided to the organization for journalists that do foreign travel for basic reporting. Finally, a basic stipend is provided for educational and journalistic reporting.

A media non-profit must be transparent about any sources of donorship.  

Media and educational reporting is required by law to follow good-faith reporting and good-faith arguments.  Any reporting or media found to be knowingly presenting false-information-as-if-truth can lose there stipend for that month. If confronted with a lack of confidence in the validity of the story or the argument, it is enough to be upfront at every claim that information may be unverified or inconsistent.
