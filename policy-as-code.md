Other requirements to address:
* "Everything that is not forbidden is allowed"; some things must be listed, some things may not be
* The requirements to consider intention, and how to handle "bad laws"

# Policy as Code

Laws should be written in a way that the history is plainly accessible, much in the same way that a versioned repository would behave.

Each change should create a larger repository, or reference multiple repositories, such that there is version history, and commit messages that represent the thoughts that went into the changes being made.

A law would be made of several legal blocks.

Each legal block should comprise:
* Definitions, which may reference other previously created definitions
* Legal preconditions that indicate the context and conditions in which the legal block should be active
* Legal preconditions that filter in or out which entity or entities are affected by the law
* A description of requirements that each entity must meet
* A plan for the consequences if the requirement is not met
* A deontic diagram, especially in relation to other laws

When a pull-request is made, the following are linked:
* A living document of concerns raised by the opposition
* A ongoing listing of considered unintended consequences
  * Mitigations to be evaluated
  * Temporal exceptions that are put in place
* An analysis of the effects on various demographics

A pull-request is approved when greater than 1 and greater than 50% of empowered legislating branches (does not mean "in session", but means "given the power") have reached an agreement (i.e. 1 empowered branch cannot approve a pull request, but 2/3 or 3/5 can). The approver in each case is the clerk for the branch.

# Best Practices
Definitions, preconditions, requirements, and consequences are best discussed in variation, instead of using all-or-nothing langauge in the laws (i.e. fuzzy deontology). More often than not there are things that are immeasureable, especially in the realm of intention. However, a strive must be made to avoid legal blocks that entirely ban/allow, or impose the same punishments regardless.

It's also important that any legal block be analyzed for the following:
* effects related to disability
* effects related to age
* effects related to ethnicity
* effects related to upbringing
* effects related to income or to wealth
* additional demographics, according to ability
