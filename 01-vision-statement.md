# Guiding Principles
We enact our responsibility to organize with the purpose of governing as a nation of free peoples with awareness of our reciprocal effects, instead of a view of
governance as a right to preside over, to manage, or to command. In as much as we are capable to do so, we strive to promote a rich experience to all constituents by
honoring and investing in individual and collective agency.

To honor and to invest as such is to recognize and promote peace and stability, to sustain, and to think both inside and outside our borders about the effects of our
actions. This investment hinges on the need for our joint participation, for broad inclusion, for skilled expertise, for expansive transparency, and for rational 
accountability, and may include other unenumerated prerequisites.

We regard rights as a neverending fight to win, community as a structure requiring continuous tending to hold, and the people therein to be ever-changing. We recognize
that the promotion of rich experience prioritizes reducing undue suffering before pleasure, removing disadvantegeous blocks before advantaging others, and overall aims
to more faithfully distribute outcome in response to effort given.

Our nation can exist without a symbol. Our nation can exist without a flag. Our nation can exist without a pledge. But, our nation cannot exist without those we stand with.

This should be written as a poem or song, to be recited

## Definitions in Guiding Principals

**Responsibility** - Responsibility is simply our ability to respond.

**Ever-changing people** - People are not guaranteed to always become better, but are always changing. As such this is a rejection of the **progressive** principal that
things and people are always moving to *better*, but also doesn't foster the idea that improvement is zero-sum, leading to harm in others.

# Governing Bodies
The nation recognizes governance from the inside-outward, such that as each level increases, it is to a baseline. The foremost level is that of the self:
1. **Self-governance** - wherein the responsibility to self-govern does not require a caregiver; nor where it causes concession of the self-governance of another, or of the
collective
1. **Family governing body** - wherein a family is devoted to proxy-care and investment in various selves; geographically centered on the home
1. **District-governing body** - geographically centered on a small area that may include a schoolcare district, wherein multiple families an association, or even a tribe
may occupy and manage the affairs for that area
1. **County-governing body** - geographically over multiple districts, wherein the districts can decide wider things like zoning, property taxes, infrastucture, etc.
1. **Region-governing body** - geographically over multiple counties (often about the size of a typical US state); best continually reevaluated as (economic regions)[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166083]
1. **Substate-governing body** - geographically over multiple regions (often about the size of 10 or so US states); given whereas these substates can willingly chose to move between countries
1. **Country-governing body** - geographically over multiple substates (often about the size of the entire United States)
1. **Continental-governing body** - geographically over multiple countries (often about the size of a continent), recognizing that not every country in a continent would agree, making this a political entity, not a techtonic entity
1. **Intercontinental-governing body** - an entity made up of multiple continents, possibly almost planet-wide
1. **Aster-governing body** - an entity made up of multiple planets within a star-system. This is a political entity, and not guaranteed to be a single entity for the
entire star-system

Governing bodies may recognize entities that aren't recognized by other entities, such as a lake or river.

# Enumerated Rights
