# Earmarked Taxes

## Assumptions
Not yet described herein is both a taxation-and-distribution system with a few factors that need to be better refined:
* Citizenship is progressive from 0% to 100%, and is earned over time (TBD)
* Financial competence is progressive from 0% to 100%, and by age 24 (based on averages of psychological descriptions regarding development of risk-management), most individuals will be 100% financially competent (TBD)

## Prerequisites (UBI)
* Every registered individual has a qualification for a fixed UBI rate that begins as a fixed value
* Earned UBI is always vested, but withdrawal is considered separately
* UBI is firstly proportioned according to citizenship (TBD)
* Up to a maximum multiplier, hours (over years) devoted to public service will increase the individual's fixed UBI in order to increase participation in (note that teaching incentives will be handled differently):
  * Armed services
  * Peace services (i.e. peace corps)
  * Emergency services
  * Volunteer services for education, logistics, etc.
* Denouncing citizenship requires some financial penalization back to the system, which can also be overcome by initiating UBI stoppage program duration until it is completed. (TBD)
* The initial fixed UBI rate automatically increases proportional to the Gini Coefficient (or some measure of inequality)
* The initial fixed UBI rate  UBI should base nationally off the living requirements at the location in the nation where the **least** cost-of-living is (although most states should, most states will likely not pick up and do something similar to further level off their own cost-of-living requirements)
* Every citizen has a trust devoted to their UBI, and are capable of withdrawing proportional to their financial competence
* UBI is furnished and taxes are levied monthly, not yearly, and are automatically computed (requires discussions to investigate under-the-table purchases and employment)
* All of this depends on technology that may go offline, fail, or be hacked and so alternative handling of the situation must be discussed and mitigated.

## Taxation
* Income tax is levied at a fixed percentage of income (i.e. progressive taxation occurs by incorportation of the UBI to create an effective tax rate that is progressive).
* Tax rate adjustments have automatic and manual controls
  * Tax rate automatically increases proportional to the national debt / GDP ratio
  * Tax rate automatically decreases proportional to unemployment rate
  * Some coefficients can be controlled by legislation and/or a national bank
* Taxes levied from each individual is earmarked by percentage of their taxes
  * A *default* breakdown is provided, and the individual taxpayer overrides it
  * A taxpayer who has overridden a previous month will find that as the default to the next month
  * Otherwise, a taxpayer will find their defaults are given as a *desired* value from congress
* Earmarks are typically divided according to organization such as EPA, DOJ, NASA, etc.
  * This will slow some of the massive changes in funding that these organizations deal with on a yearly basis
  * This will make the organizations beholden to the people who fund them, in that taxpayers will likely not fund an organization doing things they disagree with
  * Any use of local emergency services will serve as a bill that is payed by tax payer's taxes taking 100% of the earmarks each month, until paid off, effectively meaning that you cannot earmark your taxes for any other use until paid off
  * For the most controversial of projects or activities, a per activity percentage can be provided, such as examples for:
    * Local
      * 
    * Federal
      * Business
        * SBIR
        * etc.
      * Science
        * Education
        * Space, Weather, and Climate Monitoring
        * Astrophysics and Particle Physics
        * Biology and Medicine
        * etc.
      * Engineering
        * Space exploration
        * Olympics Site
        * Flood mitigation
        * etc.
      * Military
        * Administrative      
        * Monitoring
        * Defensive infratructure
        * Veteran Services
        * Current wars and/or allied support
          * Ukraine war
          * Iraq war
          * etc.          
      * etc.

# Other Taxes

* Transaction

    * larger for transactions that include buyer's insurance (such as credit cards)
    * also larger for stock transactions, to reduce high-speed trading

  * Corporations are taxed on revenues with the following discounts:

    * Returns on sales
